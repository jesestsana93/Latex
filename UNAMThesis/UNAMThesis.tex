\chapter{About this Style}

This document provides a sample of the UNAMThesis package. This style provides a
customizable format to typeset thesis (grad and undergrad) according to the Universidad
Nacional Aut\'{o}noma de M\'{e}xico guidelines. This style is provided with support to be
used in Scientific Workplace (SWP) 3.x \citep{Barabasi2002,Freyre-Gonzalez2008,
Freyre-Gonzalez2005}.

The front matter has a number of sample entries that you should replace with
your own \citep{Gottesman1984,Griffith2002,Hartwell1999}.

\section{Package usage}
Escudo-UNAM and Escudo-IBT must reside in your main document directory. The style looks
for these files to draw the logos on the cover page. You may customize the logos using
the \texttt{\textbackslash{}logounam\{path\_file\}} and
\texttt{\textbackslash{}logoinstitute\{path\_file\}} commands in the preamble to define
the files location and name.

The \texttt{\textbackslash{}university\{university name\}} command allows you to customize
the university name, which defaults to 'Universidad Nacional Aut\'{o}noma de M\'{e}xico'.

In addition, \texttt{\textbackslash{}institute\{institute name\}}, \texttt{
\textbackslash{}rcenter\{research center name\}},
\texttt{\textbackslash{}faculty\{faculty name\}}, or
\texttt{\textbackslash{}school\{school name\}} commands allow to set the institution name
where you carried out your studies. The rationale for use different commands is to
autoselect the correct gender for the definite article. However, these are optionalcommands,
so in case you omit the institution name, the gender of the definite article in the title
page is set by default to female ('la') to match with the gender of the word 'universidad'.
You could customize it using \texttt{\textbackslash{}@instituteartm} to set to male the
definite article ('el') or \texttt{\textbackslash{}@instituteartf} to set it to female
('la'). The \texttt{\textbackslash{}department\{department or program name\}} command is
optional.

The style implements environments for dedication, acknowledgements, foreword, resumen and
abstract. Besides, there are command versions for all these environments (except abstract)
named: \texttt{\textbackslash{}makededication\{...\}},
\texttt{\textbackslash{}makeacknowledgements\{...\}},
\texttt{\textbackslash{}makeforeword\{...\}} and
\texttt{\textbackslash{}makeresumen\{...\}}. These command versions are useful to interface
with SWP due to some bizarre restrictions; so, if you are using standard LaTeX (without SWP)
please use the enviroments.

In addition, this style implements the quotenat environment (\texttt{\textbackslash{}begin\{
quotenat\} ... \textbackslash{}end\{quotenat\}}) for opening quotes (quotations commonly used
at the beginning of a chapter).

The UNAMThesis bibliographic style enables the use of author-year schemes using the natbib
package. Citation to e-print archives (e.g., arXiv) is possible using the \texttt{eprint}
{{\sc Bib}\TeX} field \citep{Keseler2005,Leskovec2008,Lipschutz1986,Marconi1967,
Neidhardt1996,Nelson2000}.

\chapter{Features of this Style}

\begin{quotenat}
\textsl{I worry that, especially as the Millennium edges nearer,\\
pseudo-science and superstition will seem year by year more tempting,\\
the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive.}\\
--- \textsc{Carl Sagan, \textit{The Demon-Haunted World} (1995)}

\end{quotenat}

\section{Section}

Use the Section tag for major sections, and the Subsection tag for subsections.

\subsection{Subsection}

This is just some harmless text under a subsection.

\subsubsection{Subsubsection}

This is just some harmless text under a subsubsection.

\paragraph{Subsubsubsection}

This is just some harmless text under a subsubsubsection.

\subparagraph{Subsubsubsubsection}

This is just some harmless text under a subsubsubsubsection.

\section{Tags}

You can apply the logical markup tag \emph{Emphasized}.

You can apply the visual markup tags \textbf{Bold}, \textit{Italics},
\textrm{Roman}, \textsf{Sans Serif}, \textsl{Slanted}, \textsc{Small Caps},
and \texttt{Typewriter}.

You can apply the special, mathematics only, tags $\mathbb{BLACKBOARD}$
$\mathbb{BOLD}$, $\mathcal{CALLIGRAPHIC}$, and $\mathfrak{fraktur}$. Note that
blackboard bold and calligraphic are correct only when applied to uppercase
letters A through Z.

You can apply the size tags {\tiny tiny}, {\scriptsize scriptsize},
{\footnotesize footnotesize}, {\small small}, {\normalsize normalsize},
{\large large}, {\Large Large}, {\LARGE LARGE}, {\huge huge} and {\Huge Huge}.

This is a Body Math paragraph. Each time you press the Enter key, Scientific
WorkPlace switches to mathematics mode. This is convenient for carrying out
``scratchpad'' computations.

Following is a group of paragraphs marked as Body Quote. This environment is
appropriate for a short quotation or a sequence of short quotations.

\begin{quote}
The buck stops here. \emph{Harry Truman}

Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your
country. \emph{John F Kennedy}

I am not a crook. \emph{Richard Nixon}

It's no exaggeration to say the undecideds could go one way or another.
\emph{George Bush}

I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. \emph{Bill Clinton}
\end{quote}

The Quotation tag is used for quotations of more than one paragraph.
\ Following is the beginning of \emph{Alice's Adventures in Wonderland }by
Lewis Carroll:

\begin{quotation}
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank,
and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her
sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what
is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'

So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day
made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a
daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very
much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, 'Oh dear! Oh dear! I
shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that
she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its
waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her
feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit
with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with
curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time
to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the
world she was to get out again.
\end{quotation}

Use the Verbatim tag when you want \LaTeX {} to preserve spacing, perhaps when
including a fragment from a program such as:
\begin{verbatim}
#include <iostream>        // < > is used for standard libraries.
void main(void)            // ''main'' method always called first.
{
  cout << ''Hello World.'';  // Send to output stream.
}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Mathematics and Text}

Let $H$ be a Hilbert space, $C$ be a closed bounded convex subset of $H$, $T$
a nonexpansive self map of $C$. Suppose that as $n\rightarrow\infty$,
$a_{n,k}\rightarrow0$ for each $k$, and $\gamma_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(
a_{n,k+1}-a_{n,k}\right)  ^{+}\rightarrow0.$ Then for each $x$ in $C$,
$A_{n}x=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{n,k}T^{k}x$ converges weakly to a fixed point of
$T$ .

The numbered equation
\begin{equation}
u_{tt}-\Delta u+u^{5}+u\left|  u\right|  ^{p-2}=0\text{ in }\mathbf{R}
^{3}\times\left[  0,\infty\right[  .\label{eqn1}
\end{equation}
is automatically numbered as equation \ref{eqn1}.

\section{Lists Environments}

You can create numbered, bulleted, and description lists using the tag popup
at the bottom left of the screen.

\begin{enumerate}
\item List item 1

\item List item 2

\begin{enumerate}
\item A list item under a list item.

The typeset style for this level is different than the screen style. \ The
screen shows a lower case alphabetic character followed by a period while the
typeset style uses a lower case alphabetic character surrounded by parentheses.

\item Just another list item under a list item.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Third level list item under a list item.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fourth and final level of list items allowed.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\item Bullet item 1

\item Bullet item 2

\begin{itemize}
\item Second level bullet item.

\begin{itemize}
\item Third level bullet item.

\begin{itemize}
\item Fourth (and final) level bullet item.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
\item[Description List] Each description list item has a term followed by the
description of that term. Double click the term box to enter the term, or to
change it.

\item[Bunyip] Mythical beast of Australian Aboriginal legends.
\end{description}
